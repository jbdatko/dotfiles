Datko's Dotfiles
================

I'm slowing building up my collection of dotfiles.  These probably won't work
for you out of the box.  I'm hoping that they work for me if/when I migrate
computers.

But hey, you have to start somewhere.

Packages:
--------

1. emacs.  My main elisp config files are here.  Most of the packages and elpa
would have to be re-downloaded.  If you are looking for an out-of-the-box emacs
experience, I highly recommend [prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude).
